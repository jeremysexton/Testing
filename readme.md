# Testing Working Copy

This is Working Copy, I'm trying to make a Github situation. We'll see how it works!

## Turns out, pretty good!

This works relatively well. I suppose I could develop from this. I'd need to create a dev server and edit code from it using Working Copy here. I suppose I could also just create a dev server, edit those files directly and then save them on the server, then use the terminal in here or w/e to push to the production server when ready. Don't see why that wouldn't work, too. Shoot, could even use Working Copy to make that happen if I didn't want to do the git thing in terminal.
